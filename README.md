I am a product manager at [DIPS](http://dips.no) with a PhD in computer
science from UiT The Arctic University of Norway. In my PhD I worked on
interactive systems for explorative analysis of data from the Norwegian Women
and Cancer (NOWAC) study. I'm a former member of the [Biological Data Processing
Lab (BDPS)](http://bdps.cs.uit.no/) in the [HPDS](http://hpds.cs.uit.no/)
research group. 

You can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fjukstad), or an e-mail
at [bjornfjukstad@gmail.com](mailto:bjornfjukstad@gmail.com). I also have a site
at [fjukstad.github.io](http://fjukstad.github.io) where I keep a, not so long,
list of the research I've been involved with, as well as my newly started blog.
